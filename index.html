    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
        Hello! My name is Jaydon Tran Estantino, and welcome to my portfolio! 
    </p>
    <p>
        I am currently studying at the University of Pangasinan in Dagupan City, Pangasinan for Information Technology. I look forward to finding a career in cybersecurity in the future. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I am also a former Computer Engineering student. I decided to shift to Information Technology after my second year, first semester of AY 2023-2024 and have been studying in Information Technology 
        (As of September 12, 2024) for two semesters.
    </p>

    <h2>My College Projects</h2>

    <h3>BMI Tracker</h3>
    <p>
        I worked in a group with my classmates to make an application that allows users to calculate their BMI score and give certain advice based on the BMI score that was achieved.
    </p>

    <h3>"Math Flash"</h3>
    <p>
        This was a simple video game me and my classmates made that involved the player solving different math questions within a certain time limit.
    </p>

    <h3>"GetKeys"</h3>
    <p>
        This was a proposal website we made with the idea of it being a key reselling website that offered a variety of software ranging from video games to Windows keys.
    </p>

    <h3>Mini Game Collection</h3>
    <p>
        A colletion of different mini games such as Pong, Tic Tac Toe and Connect Four meant for mobile android devices.
